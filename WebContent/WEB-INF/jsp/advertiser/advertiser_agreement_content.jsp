10. CONFIDENTIALITY. 
<br/>
Blurb considers the Software and any technical information, evaluation or reports supplied to you to be proprietary, and you agree to treat the Software as confidential material in a manner no less protective than you use to protect your own similar assets, but in no event will you use less than reasonable care to protect the Software.

<p class="form-control-static">
11. GENERAL PROVISIONS.
<br/>
11.1 Feedback. In the event that you provide Company with feedback regarding the use, operation or functionality of the Software ("Feedback"), including but not limited to information about operating results, known or suspected bugs, errors or compatibility problems, or desired features, you hereby assign to Blurb all rights in the Feedback and agree that Blurb shall have the right to use the Feedback and related information in any manner it deems appropriate.
<br/>
11.2 Governing Law, Venue and Arbitration. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide the application of the law of another jurisdiction. You and Blurb agree to submit to the jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, the state courts located in San Francisco, California (USA) and the federal courts located in the Northern District of California (USA) in such legal action or proceeding. The application of the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods is hereby expressly excluded. Any claim or dispute (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with this Agreement where the total amount of the award sought is less than five thousand U.S. Dollars (US$ 5,000.00) may be resolved in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. Such arbitration shall be initiated through an established alternative dispute resolution provider ("ADR Provider") that offers arbitration as set forth in this section and under the rules of such ADR Provider, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with this Agreement. The party demanding arbitration will propose an ADR Provider and the other party shall not unreasonably withhold consent to use such ADR Provider. The ADR Provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; b) all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English; c) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and d) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider. You acknowledge that any breach of this Agreement by you would cause irreparable injury to Blurb for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and, therefore, Blurb will be entitled to seek injunctive relief (including specific performance) in any court of competent jurisdiction.
<br/>
11.3 Severability; Language. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives to the greatest extent possible under any applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. The parties of this Agreement have expressly required that the present Agreement be drawn up in the English language.
<br/>
11.4 No Assignment. This Agreement, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Blurb’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon assignees.
<br/>
11.5 Export. You agree not to export, directly or indirectly, the Software, any U.S. technical data acquired from Blurb, or any products utilizing such data to countries outside the United States, which export may be in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.
<br/>
11.6 Waiver. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.
<br/>
11.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement including the Blurb Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Policy, which are hereby incorporated by reference, is the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and merges all prior discussions between the parties. No modification of or amendment to this Agreement, nor any waiver of any rights under this Agreement, will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party to be charged (which, in the case of the Blurb, shall require the signature of a duly authorized officer of the Blurb).
</p>

<p class="form-control-static">
12. International Provisions. The following provisions shall apply only if you are located in the countries listed below.
<br/>
12.1 United Kingdom. A third party who is not a party to this Agreement has no right under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this Agreement, but this does not affect any right or remedy of such third party which exists or is available apart from that Act.
